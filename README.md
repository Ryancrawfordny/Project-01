-Dealer flips 3rd card. Player wins if they make the correct choice.

 -Concept :Dealer then deals 2 cards. 
 -Player chooses "inside" or "outside".
 -Dealer deals card 3.
 -Player wins,loses or ties. 


 -Technologies used - CSS/HTML/JS.

 -Problems faced: JS. Still feel like I need my hand held though JS. The concepts are still confusing and i'm struggling to think like a developer.

 -Potential Solution - Practice and research. I've been practicing on code academy and plan on doing that whle taking breaks from building the game. I will also use my resources here by reaching out to the instructors and to Mick for help.
