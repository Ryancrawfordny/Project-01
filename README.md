- Game "Acey Deucey"

-Rules *** 2 cards are delt to a player. When cards are delt, player chooses if the card with be "inside" or "outside" the crads.
-Dealer flips 3rd card. Player wins if they make the correct choice.

 
 -Concept : Player will place a bet($5, $10, $15, $20). Dealer then deals 2 cards. 
 -Player chooses "inside" or "outside".
 -Dealer deals card 3.
 -Player wins or loses. 
 -Money is added or subtracted from player total.
 -If player has $0 left, game is over.

 -Technologies used - CSS/HTML/JS.

 -Problems faced: JS. Still feel like I need my hand held though JS. The concepts are still confusing and i'm struggling to think like a developer.

 -Potential Solution - Practice and research. I'v been practicing on code academy and plan on doing that whle taking breaks from building the game. I will also use my resources here by reaching out to the instructors and to Mick for help.
